# API Reference

All endpoints are under `/api`. Auth is via HTTP-only cookies (set at login);
every non-public route requires a valid access token (enforced by middleware).
Bodies are validated with Zod. Errors return `{ "error": string }` with an
appropriate status (400 validation, 401 auth, 403 permission, 404 not found,
409 conflict, 422 business-rule).

## Job Descriptions
One document per employee, versioned. Uploads are `multipart/form-data`
(`file` = PDF, max 5 MB; optional `title`, `changeNote`); everything else is JSON.

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/job-descriptions` | authed | `{ mine, roster }` — `roster` is null without JobDescription.ViewAcknowledgments. Filters: `q, department, employee, status(acknowledged\|pending\|missing)` |
| GET | `/api/employees/:id/job-description` | scoped | Document + full version history |
| POST | `/api/employees/:id/job-description` | JobDescription.Upload | Appends a version and re-points the document |
| DELETE | `/api/employees/:id/job-description` | JobDescription.Delete | Removes the document, all versions and acks |
| GET | `/api/job-descriptions/versions/:versionId/file` | scoped | Streams the PDF (`inline`; `?download=1` for attachment). ETag/304 |
| POST | `/api/job-descriptions/versions/:versionId/ack` | JobDescription.ViewOwn | Self only; 409 on a superseded version |

`POST /api/employees` also accepts `multipart/form-data` (`payload` = the JSON
body, `jobDescription` = PDF) to attach a document at creation time.

*Scoped* = own document always; others per `jobDescriptionScope()` — ViewAll sees
everyone, ViewAcknowledgments sees their own department, otherwise self only.
