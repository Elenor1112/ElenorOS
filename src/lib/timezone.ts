/**
 * Timezone handling for user-entered dates and times.
 *
 * ── The problem this solves ───────────────────────────────────
 * Users pick a wall-clock time ("1:30 PM on 27 Jul"). That string carries no
 * zone, so turning it into an instant requires knowing WHICH zone it was meant
 * in. `new Date("2026-07-27T13:30")` resolves it in the *runtime's* zone —
 * which is the developer's laptop locally, but UTC on Vercel. The same input
 * therefore produced different instants in dev and in production, and Cairo
 * users saw their deadlines three hours late.
 *
 * The fix is to resolve wall-clock input against the *company's* timezone
 * (APP_TIMEZONE) rather than whatever zone the server process happens to run
 * in. Storage stays UTC (timestamptz); only the interpretation of ambiguous
 * user input is pinned.
 *
 * ── Why not just add/subtract hours ───────────────────────────
 * A fixed offset is wrong twice a year. Egypt observes DST (UTC+2 winter,
 * UTC+3 summer), so the offset is derived from the IANA database via Intl for
 * the specific date being converted, never hardcoded.
